@1011 = ~Barrier Amulet~
@1012 = ~This powerful amulet was crafted by the enchanter Celemon of Calimport in 727 DR. He crafted ten such amulets on commission before jealous rivals killed him and attempted to duplicate the procedure. His colleagues were not as talented as Celemon and destroyed their laboratory and themselves when a mishap occurred. The formula was destroyed as well. This particular amulet was owned by the elven warrior-mage Pelan Rainwind. It was lost when he was killed by giants in the Spine of the World somewhere around 840 DR.

@1022 = ~This simple steel amulet was consecrated by priests of Tempus for use by a warrior named Teln Graham. Teln was a powerful warrior, but he was easily unnerved in large battles. This badge, which he wore over his heart, allowed him to overcome his sudden panic attacks during important conflicts. It left Teln's possession when the Tempurans decided that he was an unredeemable coward. Teln is believed to have retired from adventuring to become a farmer.

He carried this horn with him when he observed many titanic battles. The chief of his tribe gave him the instrument with instructions to blow it if he was ever in mortal danger.

@1051 = ~Belt of Bones~
@1052 = ~This grim item was fashioned by priests of Myrkul, god of the dead. The heavy leather belt is set with metal plates and hoops that hold human bones. The original owner was a deadly warrior named Proud Keth. Keth rode across battlefields without fear, smashing whoever got in his way. On those rare occasions when he was surrounded, the belt came in handy. Unfortunately for Keth, his opponents eventually decided to take him down using polearms and long spears. When he was killed, his belt was buried with him. It was only a matter of time before thieves came to Keth's grave in order to loot it. One of the thieves sold Keth's belt to a practical mage from Urmlaspyr. The wizard, Isanan by name, found the belt to be very useful during his travels. When he retired, he sold the belt to a grateful priest of Myrkul named Ben-Karad. Ben-Karad is believed to have been killed somewhere in the sewers of Waterdeep.

According to their maker, Weldy Baker, the boots rely not only on the power of illusion, but the power of "potential time weave cutting and microscopic changes to minutiae in the environment that have macroscopic effects."

Priests of Arvoreen the Defender blessed the cittern with its impressive power. Relias never intended to play his magnificent creation. He eventually sold the ruddy instrument to a bard named Gallow Deely. Gallow was a lanky, slender man often found in the company of adventurers. Though ill-suited for battle, Gallow was exceptionally gifted at putting tales of heroism to music. With the aid of the cittern, he helped the Company of Frozen Trees defeat a young green dragon in 1013 DR. His song, commemorating the occasion, was a rollicking tune called "The Fight of Green Thirteen." It is played in central and western taverns to this day.

The wizard Bemban of Immersea was known to be quite fond of these pointed hats both for their appearance and their power. Many wizards sought their own Cyclocones, but their distinctive appearance soon became the butt of many jokes among adventurers.

His gang, the Cobble Boys, intimidated and oppressed various neighborhoods of Westgate for a decade until a wizard in service of Tyr, Alistar Lavell, rallied his allies against Retland's cronies. When Alistar defeated Retland and his gang, he turned Dazer over to the church of Tyr, where it was given to a traveling priest.

He earned this reputation with the help of three items: potions of speed, boots of speed, and his trusted short sword, Spell Diver. Unlike many other magical weapons, Spell Diver does not have a dark, murderous history. Naradon retired from adventuring when he was thirty-two. His fondness for potions of speed caught up with him when he died of old age four years later. His only heir had no desires to be an adventurer. He sold the weapon to a known cat burglar a few years after his father's death. The sword can be recognized by the kingfisher stamped into the ricasso.

According to philosophers of magic, Faith Killer was enchanted by the non-belief of its owner, the warrior Erion the Skeptic. A rarity in Faerûn, Erion was a man who denied the existence of holy magic and the gods themselves. He was known for his attempts to prove that priests were charlatans and holy magic was, in actuality, a different form of standard magic. Sages believe that Erion's intense opposition to holy men and women actually generated sympathetic magical powers in his weapon. Priests of Selûne in Westgate confiscated the axe when they killed Erion in self-defense. It is currently believed that Erion is one of the unbelievers used as a building block in Myrkul's Bone Castle.

The arrows are commonly used on rampaging animals but are quite effective against malicious humanoids. They are typically adorned with blue and green ribbons and flowers to show that they were created by the peacekeepers of Eldath. This makes them somewhat less effective in combat.

Intercession was made for him by an acquaintance, the wizard Peth of Elturel. The weapon itself is rather mundane in appearance, which is exactly how Kelhanion wanted it to look. It has a plain steel blade that meets a similar guard. The grip of the weapon is wrapped in dark, oiled ogre skin. The sword has a mild form of empathetic instinct, turning in the wielder's hand to impose itself in the path of melee weapons. Intercession was lost with Kelhanion when he was slaughtered by over a dozen trolls in the Trollbark Forest.

@1241 = ~The Lucky Scimitar +2~
@1242 = ~This weapon was used by a well-known Zakharan gambler named Kadan Ibn-Kadur. It is believed that the blade helped Kadan win many foolish bets that he should have lost. Kadan parted with the weapon, however, when he crossed paths with the infamous Nido Ochita Inazuma in western Faerûn. Inazuma was the son of a Cormyrean knight and a Kara-Turian noblewoman. He claimed that his mother was struck by lightning twice while she was pregnant with Inazuma—once when she learned she had conceived and again immediately before she gave birth. Legends say that Inazuma was born on the edge of the Fateful Coin, the mystical method by which Tymora and Beshaba decide whether a person will have good or bad luck throughout his or her life. Sages believe that Inazuma's coin landed on edge, making him immune to the effects of weal and woe. When he came across Kadan and his scimitar, it was only a matter of time before the Zakharan gambled his scimitar and his life into Inazuma's hands.

Despite its rather meager powers, the Merry Shorthorn is among the most well-traveled magic items in Faerûn. It is believed that Prophia took it with her to a number of elemental planes, to Elysium and Baator, and from the Spine of the World to the distant reaches of Wa. It entertained pashas in Calimshan, quelled the anger of holy slayers in Zakhara, and bolstered a crew of sailors in the Sea of Fallen Stars. The Merry Shorthorn was lost when Prophia accidentally dropped it somewhere in the great desert Anauroch.

@1281 = ~The Flaming Fists of Lin Mei~
@1282 = ~Lin Mei was described as a woman of exquisite beauty and a hellish temper. When her family urged her to find a husband, she issued a challenge to the men of the land: Whoever could make her yield in single combat could have her hand. The suitors gathered from all across Kara-Tur to test their skill, and although she fought with no weapons but her open hands, she bested every single one of them. Disappointed, all suitors left but one—a young man with kind eyes and a pair of gilded bracers, which he presented to her as a gift. "No one can hope to tame your passions," he said, "and those who would try will never understand your heart. May these trinkets serve as a reminder that your temper is your own and not to be controlled." Lin Mei did not marry that man, but she left home with him that day to seek adventure, and together they spent the rest of their lives in closer partnership than any husband and wife. Eventually the pair retired, and Lin Mei quietly disappeared from the annals of history. All that remains of her story are the bracers she wore, still burning with the fire of her untamed passion.

Some point to his talent for strategy, feeding his tribe for weeks on the spoils of a single raid, while others look to his knowledge of obscure lore. The truth is both less interesting and more: the source of Geraq's power was a strange stone, which the goblin carried everywhere he went. Where he found the stone is a mystery, as well as where it went after Geraq's mysterious disappearance, but holding it in one's hand, one can hear the whispers of Geraq's expertise sounding across the centuries. Of course, the whispers are all spoken in the language of goblins, making them more or less useless to the humanoid races; even so, the stone bestows greater knowledge on any who possess it.

He is said to have clubbed so many thieves over the head with the stick that no major criminal in Westgate could honestly claim they had never felt Peacekeeper's sting. One such criminal, a thug named Hellpin, took offense at the beating he received. Hellpin trained his dogs on Righteous Tad one foggy night. Tad managed to kill more than half of the canines before he was overborne and done in. Hellpin kept the club as a trophy in his hangout as a warning to those who might cross him.

All manner of bandits, murderers, rapists, and other worthies were left dangling from its knotty limbs; and all to the delight of the gravedigger Mordigan. For Mordigan, a secret practitioner of the necromantic arts, saw ample opportunity in which to ply his trade. Interring the remains of the evil men within close proximity of the tree, Mordigan called upon the dark powers of the negative material to perform a baleful act upon the black willow. It was given a sort of semi-sentience, and the ability to feed upon the remains of those who had so recently swung from its branches. Black roots descended into rotting flesh; and alarmingly enough, the tortured visages of the slain began to appear in the twisted knots of the black willow's bole before its burning. But, to the surprise of the villagers, the potently ensorcelled staff carved by the hands of the evil Mordigan did indeed prove to be their undoing. And thus did the hanged men of Dead Man's Tree have their revenge.

The Band favored using crossbows over bows for their ability to remain cocked and ready for long periods of time.

They can be easily recognized by their distinctive yellow and green fletching.

Shrewd and crafty by reputation, Makael applied his skills and the power of Turodahel carefully for over three decades. It wasn't until after Makael died of a magical disease that legends about the man started to spring up. It is believed by modern sages that Makael is likely to have killed over five hundred men with his sword over the years. It was widely known that Makael was neither especially strong nor tough. People assumed that it must have been the power of the sword that made his deeds possible. Makael's grave was robbed within a few years of his burial.

For the next few decades, warriors and thieves from all over the Moonsea and Dalelands schemed and murdered to get hold of Makael's legendary sword. One priest of Bane, curious about the sword's powers, stole Makael's skull for divination. When questioned about the magical abilities of the weapon, Makael's spirit answered from beyond the grave with one word, "turodahel." The Banite searched through his books for months before he discovered the origins of the word in a Netherese lexicon. Roughly translated, "turodahel" is a compound noun meaning "the power of discretion."

@1591 = ~Pig's Eye +2~
@1592 = ~A beautiful weapon with a mocking name, Pig's Eye is an elven blade dedicated to the slaying of orcs. Although its proper name is Gruumshacan, most people who know of the blade refer to it as Pig's Eye. The name is an allusion to the fateful blow which Corellon Larethian, patron of the elven race, inflicted upon Gruumsh, head of the orc pantheon. The glass-encased orc eye that rests in the hilt makes it easy to recognize.

The blade was crafted in 239 DR by an elven enchanter and weaponsmith named Shenarr Caith. After he had finished imbuing the weapon with its power, he gave it to his cousin, the ranger Velaic Caith, who put it to extensive use against orcs near Cormanthyr. His son, Tredain, and his grandson, Galesic, also employed the blade for hundreds of years without misfortune. Eventually, the Caith family decided to make the long migration to Evermeet. As Gruumshacan was not the family's moonblade, the Caiths decided to trade the weapon for some of the funds necessary to transform their ancient uncle Shenarr into a baelnorn. The last recorded remarks from Shenarr indicate that he was more than slightly amused at how the little blade had helped him defy death.

The shaft is crafted to resemble an elven femur and wrapped in tanned elf skin. A stout chain connects the shaft to a spiked ball. The entire creation is forged out of meteoric iron. It is a testament to the potential of orcish craftsmanship.

The halfling's name was Caligope, and his greatest enemy was an evil elven wizard named Eil-Makar. The wizard's tower was surrounded by a hedge maze filled with giant spiders. The elf's tower was also filled with a variety of abnormal spiders. For over a year, Caligope refused to even look at the tower. Eventually, he decided to construct a club to deal with his fear. The resulting weapon was named the Evil Spider Crusher of Doom. Caligope succeeded in his quest to rob Eil-Makar blind, and he left dozens of dead spiders in his wake.

@1631 = ~Patriot Helm~
@1632 = ~This helm was worn by the dwarven warrior Danel Silverfrost, king and martyr of the lost dwarven city-state of Silverrock. Danel's deeds are not as well known as those of many other heroic dwarves, but that is perhaps because his kingdom died with him. His nation suffered heavy losses when trolls and giants attacked it over a thousand years ago in the nearly forgotten "War of Curdling Blood." The war between the tribes of monsters and the kingdom of Silverrock was waged over fifteen years. Danel never attempted to flee his kingdom, seek the aid of neighboring countries, or abandon his people. Despite the fact that many of his subjects did indeed flee, Danel remained in Silverrock until the very end. Before the final battle of the terrible war, Danel told his people, "When ye see this plume on me head fall, I want ye to make sure that our people don't bow, like gold, but that they break, like iron." 

Almost as soon as the battle was joined, Danel charged to the front of the fray and leapt into the talons of a dozen trolls. The moment his plume disappeared from sight, every man, woman, and child remaining in Silverrock poured out of the fortified caverns and dragged down as many trolls and giants as they could. Barrels of flaming oil were dumped all over Danel's palace and the common areas of the city, consuming as many dwarves as trolls and terrible frost giants. In the end, the monsters had achieved a Pyrrhic victory. The dwarven city was a smoldering ruin from which little treasure, no slaves, and no food could be taken. Many trolls died of starvation that winter, and when they turned on their giant allies for sustenance, the entire army fell into disarray forever.

@1642 = ~This fell weapon was crafted by a beautiful and cruel wizardess who worshipped the lady of misfortune, Beshaba. Her name was Redani, and she was known both for her powers as an enchanter and a seductress. The Love of Black Bess was always given to her favored consort at any particular time. Unknown to her lovers, she would place a Ring of Readiness on the mace, saving the matching ring for a special time. When she grew tired of her consorts, as she always did, she would give the matching ring to a new lover and send the young man out to kill her old paramour. The new lover would simply call upon the ring and the mace would fly to his hand. 

Unfortunately, Redani was done in when she trusted the wrong man to kill her old lover. Gural of Chessenta, a well-disguised priest of Hoar, took it upon himself to gain vengeance for a man whose skull he had picked up by the side of a road. Unluckily for Redani, priests of Hoar will go to any length to avenge the dead, even if it means animating all of her dead lovers to tear her limb from limb.
